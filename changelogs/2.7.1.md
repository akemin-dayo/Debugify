- Further improve [MC-26757](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-26757) (the tooltip going off-screen one)
  now Debugify can wrap tooltips only when even centering tooltips makes them going off-screen,
  maintaining parity with Bedrock AND completely fixing the issue altogether.
- Better compatibility for some fixes - Techniques of modifying certain game code have been improved
